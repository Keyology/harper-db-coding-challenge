## Here we can define any tables in our database. This example shows how we define a type as a table using
## the type name as the table name and specifying it is an "export" available in the REST and other external protocols.
# type TableName @table @export {
#     id: ID @primaryKey # Here we define primary key (must be one)
#     name: String # we can define any other attributes here
#     tag: String @indexed # we can specify any attributes that should be indexed
# }

type User @table @export {

    # Unique identifier for the user
    id: ID @primaryKey
    
    # User's first name
    firstName: String
    
    # User's last name
    lastname: String
    
    # List of bookmarked news articles by the user
    
    # Note: Should rename to bookMarkedArticles for clarity
    newsArticleBookMarks: [BookMarkedArticles] @relationship(from: BookMarkedArticlesId)
    
    # List of preferred news sources for the user
    preferedNewsSources: [String]
    
    # Timestamp indicating when the user was created
    timeStamp: String @createdTime
}


type BookMarkedArticles @table @export {
    
    # Unique identifier for the bookmarked article
    id: ID @primaryKey
    
    # Name of the article's author
    authorName: String
    
    # Title of the article
    articleTitle: String
    
    # Description of the article
    articleDescription: String
    
    # Source of the article (e.g., website or publication name)
    articleSource: String
    
    # URL link to the article
    articleURL: String
    
    # Timestamp indicating when the article was bookmarked
    timeStamp: String @createdTime
